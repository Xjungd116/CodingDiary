# Recursive Functions
### About recursive functions:
1. An algorithm which calls itself with "smaller (or simpler)" input values, and which obtains the result for the current input by applying simple operations to the returned value for the smaller (or simpler) input.
   - Involves a stopping point.
   - Ability of a function to call itself.
   - More space as it creates a new list every time.
3. Two fundamental mechanisms:
   - A **recursive case** that causes it to call it self
   - A **base case** that causes the recursion to stop

### Example
#### 1. Normal function vs. recursive function
```Shell
# normal function
def sum(numbers):
    total = 0
    for number in numbers:
        total += number
    return total


print(sum([1, 2, 7, 9]))


# recursive function
def sum(numbers):
    if not numbers:  # if no numbers in the list
        return 0
    remaining_sum = sum(numbers[1:])
    return numbers[0] + remaining_sum


print(sum([1, 2, 7, 9]))
```
#### 2. Recursive binary search
```Shell
def binary_search_two(list, target):
    if len(list) == 0:
        return False
    else:
        midpoint = len(list) // 2

        if list[midpoint] == target:
            return True
        else:
            if list[midpoint] < target:
                return binary_search_two(list[midpoint + 1:], target)
                # recursive function need to have stopping conditions (calling it self)
            else:
                return binary_search_two(list[:midpoint], target)


def verify(result):
    print("Target found:", result)


numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
result = binary_search_two(numbers, 4)
verify(result)
```
