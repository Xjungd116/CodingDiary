# Linear Search 
(or sequential search)
### About linear search:
1. A method for finding an element within a list by search one by one from the begining.
2. O(n)
```Shell
def linear_search(list, target):
    for i in range(0, len(list)):
        if list[i] == target:
            return i
    return None


def verify(index):
    if index is not None:
        print("Target found at index:", index)
    else:
        print("Target not found in list")


numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

result = linear_search(numbers, 2)
verify(result)
```
# Binary Search 
(or half-interval search/logarithmic search)
###Â About binary search:
1. A search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.
   - by comparing the target value to the middle element of the array.
2. O(log n)
```Shell
def binary_search(list, target):
    first = 0
    last = len(list) - 1

    while first <= last:
        midpoint = (first + last) // 2
        if list[midpoint] == target:
            return midpoint
        elif list[midpoint] < target:
            first = midpoint + 1
        else:
            last = midpoint - 1
    return None


def verify(index):
    if index is not None:
        print("Target found at index:", index)
    else:
        print("Target not found in list")


numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  # the list has to be sorted

result = binary_search(numbers, 3)
verify(result)
```
