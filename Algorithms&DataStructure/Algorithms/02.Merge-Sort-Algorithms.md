# Merge Sort Algorithms
### Example:
1. Example: to sort the array: [8, 4, 5, 1, 3, 2, 6, 7]
   - first, break them into smaller array: [8, 4, 5, 1] and [3, 2, 6, 7]
   - second, [8, 4], [5, 1], [3, 2], [6, 7]
   - third, and break into single element array
   - then merge + sort at the same time, [4, 8], [1, 5], [2, 3], [6, 7]
   - [1, 4, 5, 8] and [2, 3, 6, 7]
   - finally [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
