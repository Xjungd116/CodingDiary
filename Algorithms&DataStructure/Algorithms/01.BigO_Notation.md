# Big O Notation
### What is Big O Notation
1. Describe the complexity of an algorithm as a function of the size.
2. **N**: Number of elements an function operating on
   - **log n**: Number of times need to divide in haf until reach results.

### Runtime efficiency
1. Types: Constant, linear, logarithmic, and quadratic.
2. Efficient (Polynomial runtime):
   - O(n), O(n^k), O(n log n)
3. Inefficient (Exponential runtime):
   - O(X^n), brute force

### Pros and Cons
1. Pros:
   - Describe how the run time of an algorithm increase as data set it's operating on gets really big.
2. Cons:
   - Only tells number of times an operation performed. But, **doesn't describe duration of operation**.

### Big O in examples
1. Selection sort: O(n^2)
2. Quick sort: (on average performs better, more common)
   - O(n log n) - best case if pick pivot exactly in half
   - O(n^2) - worst case if you pick wrong pivot
3. Merge sort: 
   - O(n log n) - best case
   - O(n^2) - worst case
4. Quick sort and merge sort
   - Use quick sort more often, as merge sort takes oprations more longer
