#### Hint: Arrays in other programming languages in Python is List.
# Arrays
### About arrays:
1. Collections of values; building blocks, [ ], where each value referenced as index
2. **Contain heterogeneous data** in python (not in Java C Swift)
3. **pointer sizes** vs **value sizes**
* Pros: constant time to access values, same pointer size (pointer as representation of diff values)
* Cons: hard to allocate contiguous memory of the same size (as data types are diff, so for others )
4. Contiguous data structure, write besides each other with no gaps, easy to retrieve value.

### Operations on Data Structure (four basics)
1. **Access**: constant time operation, based on index [0, 1, 2, ... n]
2. **Search**: linear runtime, as it has to go through every index to find certain value
3. **Insert**: linear runtime, as every element needs to be shifted over 1
4. **Delete**: linear runtime

```Shell
new_list = [1, 2, 3]

for n in new_list:
    if n == 3:
        print(True)
    else:
        print(False)

new_list.append(4)
new_list.append(500)
print(new_list)

new_list.extend([4, 7, 9])
print(new_list)
```
Run file:
```Shell
False
False
True
[1, 2, 3, 4, 500]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 500, 4, 7, 9]
```
